- [stetzine.com](https://stetzine.com) - a collaboraitve publication associated with stet / stet.art; uses medium.com but also archived/hosted on decentralized storage networks
- [stetnode.com](https://stetnode.com) - a BitClout Full node; API used by stet.art (possibly others); modified ref client UI; serves as the stet social network and NFT/monetary transactions
- [estetica](https://estetica.love) - a curation model and network that will be central to the stet.art project (more info forthcoming).

### Other aspects of stet

- stetizen - "members" of the stet community; get perks on the stet platform; $stetizen creator coin used for utility purposes (e.g. onchain registry, member badge etc)
- $stet creator coin - a utility token with a circular economy model used to emphasize Founder Reward (FR) for platform fee coverage and take advantage of onchain tracability (immutable transactions) for the purpose of a reference ledger that enables the stet platform's "credits" system.
- $stetzine creator coin eventually will be used as a partial incentive for publication contributors 
- NFTs created by stet - used to sell services and products, access-control and user "password" storage (Unlockable Content)
- decentralized storage networks - integrations with Arweave, IPFS, Hypercore, Sia, Holo etc where appropriate and opinionated exposure to users

### Ambitions

the parent entity of stet is stet.studio and the primary focus is creating the stet platform that intends to be a blockchain-agnostic NFT centric project with a strong community of artists, collectors, developers, marketing creatives and others.

the founding team believes that the current tech and art movement can also raise the bar on how positive societal and cultural impact projects can succeed.
stet wants to help foster and promote these types of projects as much and as often as possible.

stet is an indie project and has a fluid mission, an edgy vibe and a flexible organic brand.
